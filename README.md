# Task Management

Learned all about NestJS thanks to the following course: https://www.udemy.com/course/nestjs-zero-to-hero/

I installed the NestJS CLI and made use of nest, npm, and yarn commands, although mainly yarn, which made everything smooth. Having a good instructor helped a lot,  and I was able to follow and understand the processes required to build a Task Management Application (REST API) without being too confused at the end...

From the very basics, when we're talking about Modules, Controllers, Providers, and Services, to the use of DTO's, repositories, entities,statuses, imports, exports, directories, types, uuid's, etc.

Commands used:
-yarn global add @nestjs/cli
-nest -v
-nest new nestjs-task-management (chose yarn over npm in this case)
-nest g
-nest g --help
-nest g module tasks
-yarn start:dev
-nest g controller tasks --no-spec
-nest g service tasks --no-spec
-yarn add uuid
